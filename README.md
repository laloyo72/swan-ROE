# HRES operational for Wave Forecasting
This system forecasts +24h of wave conditions around the Balearic Islands. It focuses on Palma de Mallorca's bay/port, but it can be adapted to any location within Mallorca.
## Requirements
Before running the system, you need to set up a few things:

### 1. SWAN Model
You need to have SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore) compiled with NetCDF support. You can follow the instructions in the [Implementation Manual](https://swanmodel.sourceforge.io/download/zip/swanimp.pdf) to download and compile SWAN.

### 2. utm Python Library
This project requires the `utm` library to convert coordinates. You can get the library from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Turbo87/utm).

### 3. Python Virtual Environment
A Python virtual environment is recommended for managing dependencies. You can create one and install the necessary packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
python3 -m venv utm_env # you could call utm_env as you wanted and modify its source in the bash script
source utm_env/bin/activate  # linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Create a Nixtla Account (if model adjustment with timeGPT is wanted)
If you do not want to adjust the model's output with timeGPT just comment the line that executes `timeGPT.py` in the bash script.
Otherwise, go to [nixtla dashboard](dashboard.nixtla.io) and create an account. Once there, create an API key and save it in a `.env` file in the timeGPT folder. You can follow the instructions provided in section 2b of [Nixtla repo api-key set-up](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/nixtla/docs/getting-started/setting_up_your_api_key.html)
```bash
vi .env
```
and write NIXTLA_API_KEY=your_api_key

```
- **`automate_forecast_allINPUTfiles_timeGPT.sh`**: This file executes the operational system. Modify for your personal cases.
- **`/cases/`**: This directory holds the configuration files for various locations. Currently, there is a test case for Palma de Mallorca. However, you could configure new ones.
    - **`/palma/`**: The folder contains all the necessary files to run SWAN for Palma de Mallorca's bay, including:
        - **`/bathy/`**:
            - Bathymetry data (`bottom_ca00_HRES.dat`, etc.)
        - Input configuration files for SWAN (`input_caxx.swn`, etc.). The input_ca00.swn is the one configured to work operationally. Read the README to see the differences between input_caxx.swn.
        - Scripts to run SWAN (`swanrun`, etc.). When compiling swan in your computer you will need to cp the swanrun and swan.exe to each case you want to run. In this case I modifed swanrun so that it uses 28cores. You will need to get them by compiling SWAN in your computer.

- **`/DATA/`**: Stores all data related to the simulations, including coastline data, bathymetric data, and polygons.

- **`/scripts/`**: Contains Python scripts used for different tasks within the project. For example:
    - **`/bathy/`**:
        -  `interpolate2.py`:  Interpolates general bathymetry of Mallorca and creates the file needed to run SWAN in the region of interest, specified by input_caxx.swn
    - **`/opendap/`**:
        - `save_simar_point_to_TPAR.py`: Downloads simar data that will be used as BC. Taking into account what's specified in input.swn

- **`/timeGPT/`**: 
  - `timeGPT.py`: Runs timeGPT using each day swan fcst. It adjustes the model's result to what the tyde gauge in located in Palma de Mallorca could measure.
  - `.env`: I have not uploaded mine. You will need to create a nixtla account and save the nixtla key here.

- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies which files and folders should be ignored by git.

- **`requirements.txt`**: A list of all the Python dependencies needed to run the project. You can install the necessary packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- **`README.md`**: This file that explains the purpose and structure of the repository.
## How to use
If the Requirements are satisfied you should be able to run the operational system like:
```bash
./automate_forecast_allINPUTfiles_timeGPT.sh
```
This will launch the forecast process. You’ll see output files created in the following locations:
- 🌊 **SWAN predictions** → `./cases/palma/output/times/YYYYMM/`
- 🤖 **TimeGPT predictions** → `./timeGPT/prediction/YYYYMM/`

## Create a new case
